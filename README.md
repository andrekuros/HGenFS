# HGenFS
Hybrid Genetic Algorithm to solve FSTSPD

This is an academic project that aims to implement an Genetic Algorithm with heuristics to improve its performance when optimizing FSTSPD problems.

# Status:
- C++ HGenFS is working well (equivalent to state of art algorithms) for 10 clients datasets
- For 100 clients the optimizations is not good enough
