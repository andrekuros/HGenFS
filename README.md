# QLGen-TSPD
Q-Learning based Genetic Algorithm to solve TSP with Drone problems

This is an academic project that aims to implement an Genetic Algorithm that use Q-Learning to improve their performance when optimizing TSPD problems.

# Status:
- C++ QLGen is working, but whithout Reinforcement Learning yet.
- AMPL exact solution is implemented, but still have some problems.
